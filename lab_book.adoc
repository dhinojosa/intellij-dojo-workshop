. Run `mvn compile` quickly, both by going to the Maven tool window and selecting *compile*
. Close all windows
. Close all the tabs through, *Shift+Shift* or *CMD+SHIFT+A*
. Open `Deck` using *CMD+SHIFT+O*
. Maximize the editor
. Run `mvn test` using `Run Anything` using *Ctrl+Ctrl*

== Lab ?: Find your file without your mouse

. Use "Find Action" to run "Close All Tabs"
. Locate files quickly, and bring them up quickly, ready for you to edit
. Use "Find In File" to find `game.initialDeal`
. Use "Go to Class" to find Deck

== Lab ?: Find the Errors
. Go to `DeckTest`
. Find all minor errors quickly
. Fix them using option-enter, alt-enter
. Fix the errors that you found in the file

== Lab ?: Create the files quickly without your mouse and efficiently

. Be sure to use *ALT+INSERT* or *CMD+N*
. Now we will create a Java class in the `com/jitterted/ebp/blackjack` called ``
. 
== Lab ?: Using the blob!

. Find the file `Game.java`
. Go to the method `main`
. Highlight only the text `System.console().readLine() using increase code selection
. Now use surround block on the selection, and wrap it in a try/catch/finally block that will catch an `IOError` and print the message

== Lab ?: Go to Implementations and Usages

. Go to `Deck` and then go to the `size` method
. Which other methods are using this method? Use CMD+B or OPT+F7
. Jump to one of the methods that uses `size`
. Go to `Game` and then go the constructor of `Game`, from here go to the implementation of `Deck`

== Lab ?: Moving Code

. Make `main` the last method and move it above `main`

== Lab ?: Documentation and Info

. Go to Maven Tool and "Download Sources and/or Documentation", you'll need to use the mouse
. Dismiss the Maven Tool Window
. Using "Find Symbol" go to `displayFinalGameState`. What is the type of `dealerHand`?
. Go to `displayHand` using whatever maneuver you like, put your cursor over `joining`, what is the documentation for this method?
. What is the type of `Collectors.joining( ansi().cursorUp(6).cursorRight(1).toString())`

== Lab ?: Efficient Running and Testing

. Run the main method in `Game` using the keyboard
. Open `CardTest` and run `withValueOfQueenHasNumericValueOf10` only
. Go to the `Card` class
. Run `withValueOfQueenHasNumericValueOf10` but don't go back to the `CardTest`!
. Open `CardTest` and run `withValueOfQueenHasNumericValueOf10` and `withNumberCardHasNumericValueOfTheNumber` only
. Open `Game`, use recent files to go back to the game
. Run the same two tests we just did without going back to `CardTest`
. Run all the tests in `CardTest`
. Run all the tests in the `com.jitterted.ebp.blackjack`

== Lab ?: Toggling your Test

. Go to `Card` using the toggle
. Go back to `CardTest`
. Go back to `Card`
. Create a test called `WalletTest`, remember *CMD+N*?
. Create a test called `walletHasZeroBalance` and create a `Wallet`

== Lab ?: Debugging

. Debugging Streams

== Lab ?: Refactoring

. Highlight the lines in the method ...
. Extract it to a new method
. 

== Lab ?: Advanced Refactoring

. Move that method to a class
. Use the *Make Static* refactoring

== Lab ?: Hey Emmitt!

. Create a resources folder in `src/main` and add a file called _index.html_
.
