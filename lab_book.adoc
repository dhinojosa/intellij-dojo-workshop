Make it fun

== Lab 1: Tool Windows without your mouse

. Open the windows that will be said, be quick, be sure, about it
. Run `mvn compile` quickly, both by going to the Maven tool window and selecting *compile*
. Close all tool windows
. Close all the tabs through, *Shift+Shift* or *CMD+SHIFT+A*
. Open `Deck` using *CMD+SHIFT+O*
. Maximize the editor
. Run `mvn test` using `Run Anything` using *Ctrl+Ctrl*

== Lab 2: Find your file without your mouse

. Use "Find Action" to run "Close All Tabs"
. Locate files quickly, and bring them up quickly, ready for you to edit
. Use "Find In File" to find `game.initialDeal`
. Use "Go to Class" to find Deck

== Lab 3: Find the Errors

. Go to `DeckTest`
. Find all minor errors quickly
. Fix them using option-enter, alt-enter
. Fix the errors that you found in the file

== Lab 4: Create the files quickly without your mouse and efficiently

. Be sure to use *ALT+INSERT* or *CMD+N*
. Create an enum in  `com/jitterted/ebp/blackjack` called `Currency` with the values Dollar, and Euro, for a challenge add the symbol
. Now we will create a Java class in the `com/jitterted/ebp/blackjack` called `Chip`
. Create two fields, one `amount` of type `int`, and `currency` of type currency
. Add a toString, equals, and hashcode for Chip

== Lab 5: Using the blob!

. Find the file `Game.java`
. Go to the method `main`
. Highlight only the text `System.console().readLine() using increase code selection
. Now use surround block on the selection, and wrap it in a try/catch/finally block that will catch an `IOError` and print the message

== Lab 6: Go to Implementations and Usages

. Go to `Deck` and then go to the `size` method
. Which other methods are using this method? Use CMD+B or OPT+F7
. Jump to one of the methods that uses `size`
. Go to `Game` and then go the constructor of `Game`, from here go to the implementation of `Deck`

== Lab 7: Moving Code

. Make `main` the last method and move it above `main`
. Rearrange the other methods to your liking

== Lab 8: Documentation and Info

. Go to Maven Tool and "Download Sources and/or Documentation", you'll need to use the mouse
. Dismiss the Maven Tool Window
. Using "Find Symbol" go to `displayFinalGameState`. What is the type of `dealerHand`?
. Go to `displayHand` using whatever maneuver you like, put your cursor over `joining`, what is the documentation for this method?
. What is the type of `Collectors.joining( ansi().cursorUp(6).cursorRight(1).toString())`

== Lab 9: Efficient Running and Testing

. Run the main method in `Game` using the keyboard
. Open `CardTest` and run `withValueOfQueenHasNumericValueOf10` only
. Go to the `Card` class
. Run `withValueOfQueenHasNumericValueOf10` but don't go back to the `CardTest`!
. Open `CardTest` and run `withValueOfQueenHasNumericValueOf10` and `withNumberCardHasNumericValueOfTheNumber` only
. Open `Game`, use recent files to go back to the game
. Run the same two tests we just did without going back to `CardTest`
. Run all the tests in `CardTest`
. Run all the tests in the `com.jitterted.ebp.blackjack`

== Lab 10: Toggling your Test

. Go to `Card` using the toggle
. Go back to `CardTest`
. Go back to `Card`
. Create a test called `WalletTest`, remember *CMD+N*?
. Create a test called `walletHasZeroBalance` and create a `Wallet`

== Lab 11: Debugging

. Go to `HandValueAceTest` and the `handWithOneAce` method
. Put a breakpoint on the `assertThat(game.handValueOf(cards)).isEqualTo(11 + 5);`*CMD+F8*
. Debug the method *CTRL+SHIFT+D*, what are the contents of cards?
. Stop the debugging session
. Remove the breakpoint

. Go to `displayHand` in the most efficient way possible
. Toggle the breakpoint in on the `map` call
. Run the Debugger
. Turn on the Stream Debugger
. View the Stream Debugger

== Lab 12: Refactoring

. Go to initial deal method in main
. Highlight the lines the first round of cards into a method call dealRound in the method using the blob
. Make it so that the it is called twice
. Extract another method in the first part of the main method from `AnsiConsole.systemInstall()` to `Hit Enter to Start` and create a method called display welcome screen 
. View Demo on Refactoring Rank, do the same for Suit!

== Lab 13: Advanced Refactoring

. Move that method to a class
. Use the *Make Static* refactoring
. Static Manuevering to class
. Create a display game, attempt to perform some refactoring for game and move everything that should be in game

== Lab 14: Hey Emmett!

. Open the Emmett cheatsheet: https://docs.emmet.io/cheat-sheet/
. Create a resources folder in `src/main` and add a file called _index.html_
. Create an HTML template using !
. Create a <p> with the content "Favorite Food" follow by an unordered list with 5 li items in whatever format you like listing some of your favorite foods
. Try different combinations
. Find other creative Emmet combinations
. Try your hand at styles by creating styles.css

== Lab 15: Live Templates

. Create a Live template for yourself
. Are there some classes that you create? Perhaps a standard way to do log files?
. How about a fixed thread pool? ExecutorService ec = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(10);
